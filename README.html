      <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
        <li>Python 3+  [Installed To PATH]</li>
      </ul><br />
      <h3 style="color: #fff;">USAGE:</h3>
      <u>
        <li>Copy the target file and paste it into the Mount Bar</li>
        <li>The program will not accept the whole file but will only take its address or location</li>
        <li>If you followed instructions, you'll see a message that says 'mounted'</li>
        <li>You can now search for anything in the file.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Refresh' If you want to clear the output</li>
        <li>You can click 'File' then 'Print' (to view in notepad) or 'Print to Browser' To view in browser.</li>
        <li>Supported File Formats: .txt, .ini, .csv, .xml, .py, .java, etc</li>
      </u><br />
      <p>Currently, Solid Parse is mostly used for retrieving hidden direct download links from websites including specific file locations on servers
        which then allows the user to download for example: a video, from an otherwise 'stream only site'.</p>
      <p>This software can work with very large text files. A lag may occur when handling such files on low end hardware.<br />
      This product comes with a text file containing more than 16 000 video game records. The name of the file is "vgsales.txt"<br />You can mount it and search for any popular video game to see how the product works e.g. Need For Speed<br /><br />
     <a style="color: #ff0000">TIP: </a>You can narrow down your search by using specific keywords. For example: Battlefield 4, instead of Battlefield. To retrieve the entire text found in a file, just click on Mount a file, and click on search without typing anything in the search bar</p>
